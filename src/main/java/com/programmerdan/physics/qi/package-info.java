/**
 * Quantized Intertia is a theoretic explanation that alters inertia at low and high accelerations.
 * 
 * It has been imagined by Michael McCulloch, a Professor at Plymouth University as of June, 2020.
 * 
 * He proposes it solves otherwise open questions such as wide binaries, and problems that require
 * somewhat arbitrary dark-matter distributions like galactic rotation.
 * 
 * In addition, he recently proposed new formulations that may offer some explanation for universal
 * expansion, without the need for a dark energy field.
 * 
 * This theory offers some testable predictions, most notably around very low or very high accelerations,
 * and various experiments are under way to see if the effects predicted do in fact exist.
 * 
 * The author is still in the process of firming up and exploring the theoretic impact of his
 * core assumptions, and much work is as of yet not done, including basic work such as equivalence in
 * "normal" acceleration regimes, and hundreds of tested and demonstrated predictions of relativity.
 * 
 * It is a class of MOND -- Modified Newtonian Dynamics -- with a specific focus on the cause of 
 * inertia, which M.E. McCulloch proposes is based on information hiding at Hubble and Rindler horizon scales.
 * 
 * As it is rooted in acceleration and inertia, it impacts all forms of motion, change in motion, and could
 * impact understanding of effects like Casimir and closed cavities, if correct.
 * 
 * Given its somewhat fringe nature and the mainstream's generally hostile approach to MOND, much work
 * remains to integrate it with existing scientific facts, as it offers a significantly altered explanation
 * not in line with the conventional narrative.

 * with simulation systems I used to write as a kid using Newtonian dynamics and later, relativistic dynamics.
